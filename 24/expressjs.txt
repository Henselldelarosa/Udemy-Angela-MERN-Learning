# Creating an Express Server
1. Create a directory.
2. Create index.js file.
3. initialize NPM.
4. Install the Express Packages.
5. Write Server application in index.js.
6. Start server.

<The File where the server will run must be called index.js>

# Starting Express
import express from 'express'

const app = express()

app.listen(300, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000')
})

<Run 'node (fileName)'>

# To find out what ports are being used run this on terminal
*Windows
<netstat -ano | findstr "LISTENING">

Mac/Linux
<sudo isof -i -P -n | Listen>

# Request Vocab
1. GET = Request resource
2. POST = Sending resource
3. PUT = Replace resource
4. PATCH = Patch up a resource
5. DELETE = Delete resources

*Difference between <PUT> and <PATCH>
is that <PUT> is creating a new resource
while <PATCH> is just fixing a broken resource

# Changes to file
<Everytime Changes you need to stop the server and then restart>

# Using Nodemon
*Having to stop the server everytime you make updates
is a problem to fix this use <nodemon>
to install <npm install -g nodemon>
