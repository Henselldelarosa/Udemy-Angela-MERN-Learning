# What is JSON?
*JavaScript Objext Notation

<JSON vs JS Object>
*   The main difference of javascript Object and JSON is that
* JS Object are set as key value pairs and the object will be
* returned in a bulky way. JSON are set as string key value pair
* which allow for the values to be returned flatten. This is helpful
* because when is sent throught the internet it will be its
* minimum size and once it reaches the other size it could be
* re-expanded to its normal size.

<JSON Visualizer>
*   When JSON is sent through the internet is hard to read because
* it will be in its flatten form. To make it more readable we could
* use a JSON Visualizer.
