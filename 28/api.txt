# Intro to API's
*Application Programming interfaces

# What do API do?
*   An api bridges communication between two pieces of software. This is done making request from your
* application to another to get certain data that are currently using into your application.
* This is done by making get request to this other application and with the api you are informed if what
* kind of response you could expect.

# Examples of API's

# Formating API Requests
*Endpoints, Path Parameters and Query Parameters

# API Endpoints
1. Query Parameters
  <bored-api.appbrewery.com/endpoint?query=value>
  <bored-api.appbrewery.com> = base URL
  <endpoint> = endpoint
  <?> = before starting your first query you need a question mark
        after the endpoint
  <query=value> = query Parameters in key value pair

2. Multiple Query Parameters
  <bored-api.appbrewery.com/endpoint?query=value&query2=value2>
  <&> = adding this sign will allow you to query for Multiple values
  <query2=value2> = Without any spaces after the "&" sign add the next value


3. Path Parameters
  <bored-api.appbrewery.com/endpoint/{path-parameter}>
    * The path parameter could be something such like a name
      or and id
